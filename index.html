<p>Hello Player,</p>
<p>Hello! I know everyone in the server is reading this, well I just want to say, CLICK THE CANCEL BUTTON
The reason for this is because the owner is only 15 and he demotes everyone because a player is unhappy.
Even if you think I am wrong, I am not. I donated around $15-20 and all I got was Trial Mod, which didn't even have kick.
Don't even try applying because Fozie is shit when choosing staff, vShazer is nice so listen to him and just totally mute Ryder Xander
Also, I feel bad for this server, actually, I DON'T!
Just turn around here and give it up because all the jobs are glitched and they don't even work corretly.
If you feel like you want to DDoS, well the IP Address are: Server #1 is 206.221.183.141:27095 and Server #2 is 104.243.44.254:27045</p>
<p>Thanks, a betrayed staff member.</p>
